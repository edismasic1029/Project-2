    <p>
        I'm currently a third year undergraduate ITM student at IIT. 
        This is my first year here, having transferred from Oakton Community College, which is located in Des Plaines.

    <h2>Hobbies:</h2>
    <ul>

   <li>
       Video Games:
       I enjoy playing video games with my friends and family in my spare time. Valorant, Fifa, and Rocket League are the games I'm currently playing the most.
       Since I was four years old, when my two older brothers played the GameCube, video games have been a huge part of my life. 
       My first memory is of playing I-Ninja for the first time. Now that I have other obligations, I can only play on weekends, but when I do, I make sure it's an absolute blast.

      Activities:  
      I enjoy going to the gym and playing basketball. BasketBall is a summer activity for me, therefore if the opportunity arises, I will play.
      I generally go to the gym four to six times each week. Spending time at the gym may help to relax the mind, and the work and effort put in at the gym will pay off. For me, the gym is a haven where I can develop not just my body but also my mind.
      </li>

   <li>Hiking: 
    Hiking with my friends and family is one of my favourite activities. Hiking is popular for a variety of reasons, such as the scenery, health advantages, and long-lasting memories.
    I've hiked in a few different cities/countries. Japan. Arizona, Mexico, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Croatia are only a few examples.
